## Introduction
The dataset "ChickWeight" in R contains data on the weight of 50 chickens measured over time for 4 different types of diets.
The next slide shows a graphical representation of this data.
```{r, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(plotly)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Weight of chickens per diet type
```{r, echo=FALSE}
data("ChickWeight")
g<- ggplot(filter(ChickWeight),
       aes(x=Time,
           y=weight,
           color=Diet))+
  geom_point()
gg<-ggplotly(g)
gg
```
